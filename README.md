- This is a Capstone Project.
- The Takunda and Titukulane programs are two USAID-funded resilience initiatives in Zimbabwe and Malawi.
- The two programs aim to achieve sustainable, equitable, and resilient food, nutrition, and food security through integrated interventions.
- The overall research question of our team is: “Does participation in nutrition-focused interventions in the Takunda and Titukulane programs produce meaningful changes in food security outcomes?”
- This study specifically addresses my individual research question: “What is the impact of participation in WASH interventions on food security in Zimbabwe and Malawi during FY24?”

This dashboard provides critical insights into the effectiveness of WASH interventions on children's dietary diversity, informing policymakers and stakeholders in public health. By clearly visualizing the link between WASH practices and dietary diversity, this dashboard helps program implementers identify gaps and areas for improvement. Its findings support evidence-based decisions, enhancing the impact of public health interventions.
